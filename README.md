### **Claude Output:**  

## 🧱 Project Constitution — Python CLI Calculator

### **Purpose**  
The goal of this project is to build a simple and reliable calculator using Python and the five phases of SpecKitPlus. The project helps me practice Spec-Driven Development (SDD) by breaking work into clear steps instead of coding directly.

### **Learning Goals**
- Understand all 5 SpecKitPlus phases  
- Learn how to define requirements before implementation  
- Build confidence in AI-assisted coding  
- Produce a clean, testable calculator program  
- Practice creating structured markdown documentation  

### **Scope**
- Take two numeric inputs  
- Perform Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division  
- Prevent division-by-zero errors  
- Show results clearly in the terminal  

### **Core Principles**
- Clarity over complexity  
- Step-by-step SDD workflow  
- Testability of each operation  
- Reliability and error handling  

### **Success Criteria**
- All four operations give correct results  
- Calculator handles invalid input safely  
- Program is easy to test and modify  
- All five phases are documented inside README.md
